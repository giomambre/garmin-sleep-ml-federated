Data augmentation: generate new «fake» samples.
 
This is the most applied solution for problems 1 and 3.
It allows to balance the class distributions and the dataset 
sizes among all the clients.
Possible augmentations:
•
Add noise to existing samples
•
Apply geometric transformations to existing samples
•
Interpolate couples of samples

Transfer Learning: start from a pre-defined model that 
has been trained over sufficiently big and generic data
Multitask Learning: train the model to solve multiple 
tasks to learn more general representations
