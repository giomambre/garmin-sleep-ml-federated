Classification
Definition: Classification is a supervised machine learning task where
the model learns to predict discrete labels or categories based on
input data.
Example: Suppose you want to classify emails as either "spam" or "not
spam." You train a classification model using labeled email. The model
learns patterns (like specific keywords or sender details) and, once
trained, can classify new emails as spam or not.

Regression 
Definition: Regression is a supervised learning task where the model 
learns to predict a continuous value based on input data. Unlike 
classification, which outputs discrete labels, regression outputs 
numerical values.
Example: Suppose you want to predict the price of a house based on 
features like the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. 
You train a regression model with data, then it learns relationships 
between features and prices, so that it can predict the price of new 
houses based on features.

4. Advanced Methods: Techniques like Kalman Filtering, ARIMA 
Modeling, and Multiple Imputation offer more sophisticated

ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models can 
predict missing values based on trends, seasonality, and 
autocorrelation patterns within the time series. This approach is 
particularly effective for stationary series with recurring patterns.

TS/Signal Processing
A low-pass filter is a tool that allows low-frequency signals (like slow changes or steady
trends) to pass through while blocking high-frequency signals (like sudden spikes or
noise). In simple terms, it smooths out a signal by removing its rapid fluctuations

The cutoff frequency is the point where a filter starts to block or reduce certain parts of a 
signal. For a low-pass filter, the cutoff frequency is the highest frequency that the filter will 
allow through. Everything above this frequency gets reduced or blocked

Standardizing: Adjusts data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, making it 
follow a standard scale without restricting its range.
•
Normalizing: Scales data to fit within a fixed range, usually between 0 and 1, making values 
easier to compare directly.

3. Outlier Detection and Removal
An outlier is a data point that significantly deviates from the other observations in a dataset. 
Outliers often occur due to measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or rare events that don't 
represent the typical pattern
Purpose: Removing outliers can improve model performance, especially in cases where the
outlier doesn’t represent the general behavior of the data.

3. Outlier Detection and Removal
•
Standard Deviation Method: Identify points that are more than a set number of 
standard deviations (e.g., 3) from the mean. Remove these extreme values to reduce 
their impact on analysis.
•
 Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Calculate Q1 and Q3, then find the IQR (Q3 - Q1). 
Outliers are points below 𝑄1 − 1.5 ∗ 𝐼𝑄𝑅 and above 𝑄3 + 1.5 ∗ 𝐼𝑄𝑅 and they can therefore 
be removed.
•
Z-Score Method: Compute the z-score for each point (how many standard deviations it is 
from the mean). Points with a z-score above 3 or below -3 are typically considered 
outliers and can be removed.

Model Evaluation: Overfitting
Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying patterns in the 
training data but also the noise and random fluctuations.
This happens when the model becomes overly complex, such as having too many parameters 
relative to the amount of data, enabling it to memorize the training data instead of generalizing to 
unseen data.

Model Evaluation: Overfitting
How to identify overfitting:
•
Training vs. validation performance: The training 
accuracy is high, but validation accuracy is 
significantly lower
•
Validation loss: The validation loss increases after 
a certain number of epochs, even as training loss 
continues to decrease.

Regularization
Use dropout layers to randomly deactivate neurons during training.
Early stopping
Stop training when validation performance no longer improves.
Increase data
Gather more diverse training data or use data augmentation techniques.
Simplify the model
Reduce the number of parameters or use a less complex model.
Cross-validation
Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well across subsets of the data

Model Evaluation when having a small dataset
Crossvalidation (k-fold)
Cross-validation is a more robust evaluation method 
where the dataset is split multiple times, creating different 
train-test splits.
The most common form is k-fold cross-validation, where 
the data is divided into k subsets (folds).
The model is trained k times, each time using a different 
fold as the test set and the remaining k-1 folds as the 
training set.

Extreme Case: Leave-One-Out Crossvalidation
For a dataset with N data points, LOOCV creates N folds.
In each iteration, one data point is used as the test set, 
and the remaining N-1 points are used as the training 
set. The model is trained on the N-1 training points and 
tested on the single data point left out.
This process is repeated N times, with each data point 
serving once as the test set. The final performance 
metric is the average of the N individual test results
